Implementation of the Hopfield network in Octave (Matlab) from 2008

This is a simple implementation of the Hopfield Network in Octave ([http://octave.org](http://octave.org) : similar to Matlab), from April 17, 2008. 

Need some more work to get the plotting to work on modern versions of Octave/Matlab.
